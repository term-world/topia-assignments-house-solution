# note-from-landlord

  0:
    - There's a note addressed to you.
    - It appears to be from your new landlord.
  1:
    - Heya, new tenant!
    - Hope your travels to term-world went smoothly.    
    - The movers just got here the other day.
    - Don't worry, I let them in for you.
    - Would ya believe that moving company you hired...
    - ...didn't label your boxes?
    - They didn't really know what to do,
    - so I just had them distribute them
    - across the rooms of your house.
    - I counted [5] boxes in total.
    - They're scattered just about everywhere.
    - To unpack a `moving-box.py`,
    - just "execute" it, just like you did with this note.
    - I'm sure you know what to do.
  2:
    - There's one more piece of business
    - I'll need you to take care of, too.
    - You never signed your lease.
    - Obviously we'll need to rectify that.
    - Here's the deal...
    - ...in order to stay "hip" with the times,
    - our intern suggested we keep all our files *digitally*.
    - I figured that meant we could sell our printer.
    - So, I'm afraid we don't have a paper copy for you.
    - (No e-signatures, unfortunately.
    - The intern never showed me how to do that stuff.)
    - I'm trusting you moved in with a Printer.py? It's
    - probably somewhere in one of your boxes, so look around.
  3:
    - Anyways, just get that lease printed out and signed.
    - I'll come by at some point to pick it up.
    - That should about wrap things up here.
    - I've gotta run.
    - The pursuit for skilled free labor never ends
    - for an enterprising businessman such as myself.
    - Good luck with the unpacking, and get me that lease ASAP.
    - Your friend,
    - The Landlord
  4:
    - You put the note back down.
  5:
    - You've already unpacked.
    - You've also taken care of the lease situation.
    - You're pretty sure you don't need this note anymore.
  6:
    - You decide to keep the note for now.
    - Why?
    - You appreciate a little clutter, maybe?
    - Give your house that "lived-in" feel?
    - Who knows.
  7:
    - You toss the note.
  8:
    - You're not sure you really
    - need to read that whole note again.
    - Your landlord had a *lot* to say, after all.

  0:
    - This moving box has taken a few hits
    - over the course of the move.
    - You hope whatever's inside is still okay...
  1:
    - Oh, dear. 
    - It's your TV.
    - It's uh, taken a bit of a beating.
    - The screen is shattered to the point
    - that you wouldn't be able to see anything on it.
    - Bummer.
    - Still, you can't just *throw away* your BustedTV.py.
    - That wouldn't be very green of you.
    - You'll have to keep it *somewhere* in your house for now, 
    - at least until you can figure out what to do with it.
  2:
    - You morosely lug the BustedTV.py into the living-room.

# printer
6:
  0:
    - You start up the printer,
    - but all you get for your trouble is a warning message.
    - LOW ON CYAN INK. 
    - REPLACE CYAN INK.
    - Guess you've got some ink to track down.

  1:
    - You start up the printer...
    - ...but you realize you haven't queued up any print jobs.
    - You'll need to download a file to print first, somehow.
    - Maybe that note from the landlord has some advice?
  2:
    - You start up the printer, 
    - and you see the lease at the top of the print job queue.
    - Thanks, cliVe.
    - No warnings about low ink, either. 
    - You're good to go!
    - You hit the print button, 
    - and at first nothing seems to happen...
    - ...then you hear a whirring sound starting up...
    - ...and slowly, a piece of paper...
    - ...starts peeking out of the printer's print tray...
    - ...*very* slowly, that is...
    - ...you feel like you might be here a moment...
    - ...you forgot how old your printer was...
    - ...if you had a dime to your name...
    - ...you'd consider replacing it...
    - ...you see about half a sheet of paper
    - ...sticking out of the printer now...
    - ...still about half to go, though...
    - ...you look around the room you're in...
    - ...as good a place as any for a printer...
    - ...you guess...
    - ...the feng shui feels a little off...
    - ...but you'll live...
    - ...almost there...
    - ...so very close...
    - ...aaaaaand...
    - DONE!
    - Hopefully you won't have to print anything again.
    - Like, ever.
    - You grab the lease and sign it.
    - You don't know exactly *when* the landlord's going to come for it.
    - So for now, you fold it up and stick it in your pocket.
    - Mission accomplished.

# Couch
7:
  0:
    - You recall was something rattling around underneath the cushions
    - when you were moving the Couch earlier.
    - You boldly plunge your arm into the space between the cushions...
    - ...and fish around a bit...
    - ...before closing your fingers around
    - what is unmistakably an ink-cartridge.
    - You pull it out.
    - Cyan ink.
    - Nice.

# GameCylinder
8:
  0:
    - If you don't have a *functional* TV in the vicinity of the GameCylinder.py,

# BustedTV
9:
  0:
    - This TV is hopelessly busted. 
    - Staring at it any longer would only make you sad.

    - That'd be convenient.

# toaster
10:
  0:
    - Yep, this toaster is definitely haunted.
    - You can just *feel* this ominous energy coming from it.
  1:
    - You don't even have any bread, 
    - but still you press down on the toaster lever.
    - You feel like you *have* to.
    - A horrible, *horrible* noise emits from the toaster.
    - You'd describe it as a metallic screeching
    - combined with a sort of nightmarish wet pulsing.
    - It's hard to describe, really.
    - But as suddenly as the sound fills the room,
    - it stops.
    - The toaster dings,
    - and sure enough,
    - two slices of perfectly toasted bread are in the toaster's slots.
    - No way are you eating haunted toast though.
    - You grab the toast, 
    - and for a second you feel...unwell.
    - You promptly chuck the toast out the window
    - and suddenly you feel at ease again.
    - Phew.
  2:
    - You walk away from the undeniably haunted toaster.
    - A wise decision, you feel.
  3:
    - The toaster is no longer haunted.
    - But there's not a whole lot it can do without bread, unfortunately.
